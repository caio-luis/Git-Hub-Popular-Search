# Git-Hub-Popular-Search
App for studies that lists the most popular kotlin github repositories.

## Used:
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Kotlin Flow
- Clean Archtecture with modularization and MVVM
- Koin for dependency injection
- Retrofit and Gson for API REST
- Room for persistence (cache is still a work in progress)
- Glide

## Planning to use in future:

- Another separeted module to show repositories pull requests. 
This module will use another libraries, like Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, RxJava, Jetpack compose and other things that I want to learn!
- Also unit test and/or UI tests.
