# Git-Hub-Popular-Search
App for studies that lists the most popular kotlin github repositories.

## Used:
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Clean Archtecture with modularization and MVVM
- Koin for dependency injection
- Retrofit and Gson for API REST
- Room for cache persistence
- Glide

## Planning to use in future:

- Show repositories pull requests, using fragments with navigation. 
- Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Jetpack compose and other things that I want to learn!
- Also unit test and/or UI tests.
